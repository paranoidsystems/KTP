save folder copied here. then each file is checked for differences etc to compare to the log file on the FTP for the last upload.
upload log file should include file names. size and hash or date or something? as well as machine name.
or can log file just include rar file name and a sequentila ID? then when it is downloaded the log file is tagged as the last good back up incase something goes wrong and uploaded.
a rar file will be so much smaller so there is no need to fuss about with only the needed files...
